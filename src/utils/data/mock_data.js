    about:
      "The Volkswagen Golf GTI pioneered the hot-hatchback genre and now, after decades of existence, it is still the whipped cream atop this sundae of delectable, fun-to-drive compact machines. The GTI was redesigned for the 2022 model year, complete with updated styling and more modern interior features, but it still possesses the fun-to-drive nature that makes it a performance icon. A turbocharged, 2.0-liter, 241-hp four-cylinder is under the hood and powers the front wheels through either a seven-speed automatic or—our choice—a six-speed manual transmission. Its cabin is spacious in both the front and the back and, like every GTI since the nameplate’s inception, there’s plenty of room for cargo under the hatchback door. Whether you are new to speedy boxes-on-wheels or have been a faithful GTI fan since the early days, this latest rendition is as fun-loving as when the original first arrived on these shores.",
